# reweight
I generate higgs pt and MET by DMDrawer.C and make weight by xAna\_higgsPtReweight.C
Fat Jet is processed in xAna\_higgsPtReweight.C
the out pur reweight png files are in output directory and all of histogram processed when reweighting is in eventWeight.root.
However, the names of all are orderlessi. I will deal it in the future.
